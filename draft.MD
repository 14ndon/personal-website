# About

I am a Master’s student studying AI with a specialization in Cognitive Science at Vrije Universiteit in Amsterdam. Before moving to Amsterdam I studied Computer Science at the Colorado School of Mines, where I also minored in Public Affairs as part of the McBride Honors Program.

In my free time I like to make music and art and have an ongoing art project called Perrywinkle. At School of Mines I was a music/visual arts editor for the High Grade, where some of my artistic work was published. I also enjoy staying active, while at School of Mines I was the president of the running club. Additionally, I am often traveling and learning different languages. In 2022 I studied abroad and conducted an independent study of Spanish Language and Culture in Oviedo, Spain. There I met many friends I have continued to visit while living in Europe.

Apart from being a full-time student I am a scientific programmer for the Social AI Lab at Vrije Universiteit    where I am the primary developer of the Social Interaction Cloud, the Python framework used for courses and robotics experiments. You can find my CV and read more about my past projects all on this website.

My dream is to research and develop new creative technologies after experiencing the psychological benefits being creative has had for me.

# Art

## Wake Up The Machine

The most recent Perrywinkle album I've released, entirely created by me. You can read more about it and other Perrywinkle creations here:.

## Apple Pie for M16

A mini art showcase I created as part of a McBride class I took where we corresponded virtually with another class in Ukraine and conducted a cultural exchange. The class was discussed here in this NPR article.

It's called "Apple Pie for M16" because while the Ukrainians were telling us of a particularly delicious apple pie they eat in Ukraine, to which the Americans were extremely interested to try, one of the Ukrainian students jokingly said something along the lines of: "let's make a deal, you can send us some F16s, and we'll send you apple pie". I initially misheard him, thinking he said "M16s", but the title still works!

You can listen to the piano song of the same name I composed here.

Works were inspired by Ukrainian courage, Petrykivka art style, and spiritual transmutation.

## Asturias

Piano song I composed while studying in Oviedo, Spain, later published in the High Grade Journal of the Arts. You can listen here: https://open.spotify.com/track/1BNLCuoPuG730laemx01q9?si=e8e0a7a71ff5436.
