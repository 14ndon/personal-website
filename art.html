                        <p>A mini art showcase comprising of three poems, three AI generated images, and one piano song. It was created as part of a McBride class I took where we corresponded virtually with another class in Ukraine and conducted a cultural exchange. The class was discussed in this <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/05/04/1173765084/unlikely-connection-college-students-in-ukraine-and-the-u-s-form-a-bond" target="_blank">NPR article</a>.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>It's called "Apple Pie for M16" because while the Ukrainians were telling us of a particularly delicious apple pie they eat in Ukraine, to which the Americans were extremely interested to try, one of the Ukrainian students jokingly said something along the lines of: "let's make a deal, you can send us some F16s, and we'll send you apple pie". I initially misheard him, thinking he said "M16s", but the title still works!</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Works were inspired by Ukrainian courage, Petrykivka art style, and spiritual transmutation.</p>
                        <br>

                                        Shivers skim over my skin<br>
                                        I can't draw breath—<br>
                                        Am I in the face of death or someone I adore?

                                        A tenderness too powerful to sustain<br>
                                        It can turn one bird into a fleet<br>
                                        Or any heart into a blade

                                        If no pain means nothing to save<br>
                                        I'd rather burn in the flame.

                                        Kind soul, turned warrior<br>
                                        Future husband, father, sculptor<br>
                                        Sucked into a destructive dream's game

                                        Each one of us gone<br>
                                        Not just a body<br>
                                        But an unborn vision<br>
                                        A story left unwritten
                                        
                                        <br><br>
                                        I sit alone, safe from the slaughter<br>
                                        With the dreams I've given up<br>
                                        The painting I've put off<br>
                                        The number I never called<br>
                                        I've lost the scale of what matters.
                                        
                                        <br><br>
                                        A war born from men before us,<br>
                                        Their ambitions pressed into our bones.<br>
                                        And as a hollow blooms in my chest, I wonder<br>
                                        What could we build,<br>
                                        If we refused to let go?
                                        
                                        <br><br>
                                        His spirit remains in me<br>
                                        I open my lungs and breathe it in<br>
                                        It tells me to carry our dreams on, to cling to them<br>
                                        That's how we'll take our revenge

                                        I am the little man<br>
                                        Surrounded by tanks<br>
                                        And words that can only blame

                                        I am the ruler of my own state

                                        I have something eternal that power can't take<br>
                                        It tries to rake out of me what it desperately craves<br>
                                        A sense of self not dictated by rank
                                        
                                        <br><br>
                                        With each bullet hole, a leak in its own soul<br>
                                        To be covered up with billboards, lies, and paper mache<br>
                                        Until all that's left is a mirage, an empty gaze
                                        
                                        <br><br>
                                        So I look at the starving bear on the horizon<br>
                                        And grin as it fades<br>
                                        I have no reason to be afraid
